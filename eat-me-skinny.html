                <p>
                    Nutritional coach Ellen Cepeda required a new look and feel to her existing blog. Ellen's previous
                    blog didn't truly reflect her bold and vibrant nature and was also lacking basic e-commerce
                    functionally - Ellen wanted to expanding her business offering so that she was able to sell
                    downloadable meal plans as well as inform clients of her yoga class availability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By establishing a brand identity that uses a vibrant colour palette, high contrast imagery and bold typography meant that users could instantly get a sense of Ellen's fun and energetic personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To really reinforce the brand, a set of three downloadable meal plans and detoxes were designed
                    through the same process, ensuring that the same bold and fun aspects from the website were
                    transferred into the digital books.
