                <h3>Ana Muriel Wellness</h3>
                <p>
                    With over 16 years experience as a holistic health coach and established Jivamukti teacher, Ana
                    needed a place to share her musings online as well as promote her classes, nutritional programmes
                    and upcoming events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The aim of the site was to give her thoughts somewhere to live online and to also allow visitors to
                    sign up to classes and learn more about holistic living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By understanding how Ana used social media it became apparent that the sharing of messages, imagery
                    and other media with her network was of the utmost importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind, the final website became an image driven, which also incorporated blog stories,
                    social feeds and information on all of Anaâ€™s courses and programme, in a modular and fluid layout.
                </p>
