                <p>
                    58 Victoria Embankment approached Why Studio to create, execute and develop a brand identity
                    including a website for their new event space 58VE.
                </P>
                <p>
                    58VE is a innovative event space that caters for a range of clients, from those wishing to host a
                    small and interment meeting to conferences and wedding receptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a stunning central London location and clear panoramic views of the River Thames, this venue
                    had to have an identity that felt equally as sophisticated and impressive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sites primary users were those tasks with researching and booking event spaces. Therefore we
                    led with a stop motion animation of the River Thames to instantly communicate location as well as
                    sell the benefits of the rooftop terrace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create an engaging experience, we created interactive 3D floor plans to allow users to really
                    get a sense of the space and how their event could sit within it. Not only did this provide a great
                    functionality to a user, it is also what sets the 58VE website apart from it's competitors.
