                <h3>Tinderflint</h3>
                <p>
                    Tinderflint's presence and back catalogue of work had grown dramatically and as a result their one
                    page website was crowded with content and lacked direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To give the site an updated look and feel snippets of the looping 2015 showreel was brought to the
                    forefront of the website which created a platform to entice users
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also by giving the casestudies their own landing page allowed for the use of full bleed imagery.
                    This imagery not only gave the user a taste for each project but also created an high-impact visual
                    effect.
                </p>
                <p> Tinderflint are a social team by nature, therefore by incorporating Instagram, Twitter and the blog
                    into one space, meant this hub of social activity would show off their personality which was
                    lacking in their previous one page website.
