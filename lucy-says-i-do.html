                        Designer and illustrator Lucy Clark, already had an inspirational blog and a successful Etsy store for her bespoke stationery business Lucy Says I Do. As Lucy's business and product range continued to grow, Lucy Says I Do required a website that would house the blog and web store.

                <p>
                        As Lucy has such beautiful illustrations, it felt necessary to bring these to the forefront of the site. By incorporating these illustrations and movement into the process page really allowed the page to come to life and aided the communication of Lucy and her teams bespoke design service.
