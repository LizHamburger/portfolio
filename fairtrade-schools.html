                <h3>Fairtrade Schools</h3>
                <p>
                    Fairtrade schools required an overhaul of their exsisting website which was in need of clear messaging about who Fairtrade are and what Fairtrade schools do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By throughly engaging with potential users first hand meant that the designs were based on valuable insights as to how these resources were used and how important that these resources were showcased in an inspiring way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To ensure the purpose of the website was clear, bright and fun images of children taking part in Fairtrade activities were brought to the forefront of the website.
                </p>
                <P>
                    Also by using colour as a way of organising information and resources meant that users could easily navigate through content.
                </P>
